SPQR Ball Perceptor
=================

### Introduction

SPQR Ball Perceptor is a software module for black and white ball detection developed by the SPQR to be used within the BHuman framework. This repo is a fork from the official [2016 B-Human code release](https://github.com/bhuman/BHumanCodeRelease).

### A Supervised Approach

The SPQR Ball detector is based on a supervised approach implemented in OpenCV. In particular, an LBP binary cascade classifier has been trained to detect the ball.
Details about how to generate the classifier are available in the tutorial ["How to Use OpenCV for Ball Detection -
RoboCup SPL Use Case"](http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~bloisi/tutorial/balldetection.html).
